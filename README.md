## Hi there 👋

# Hi, I’m Ray 😊
AI Analyst learning Data Engineering. I build small pipelines, bake literal cookies, and turn messy data into usable insights.

**Current focus:** learning end-to-end data pipelines — ingestion → transform → storage → basic data products.

**Tech & tools**
- Python · SQL · Git · Jupyter · Windows (PowerShell)  
- Pandas · Requests/BeautifulSoup · Docker (learning) · Airflow / Prefect (learning)  
- File formats: CSV · Parquet · JSON

**Selected projects**
- **Job Scraper** *(WIP)* — Scrapes job listings, parses key fields, and exports structured CSV/JSON.  
  **Stack:** Python, BeautifulSoup, pandas — *Status:* parsing + export working; next: add tests & basic ETL steps.

**Learning roadmap**
1. Finish Job Scraper: parsing, tests, and tidy README.  
2. Build a small ETL (CSV → transform → Parquet) and orchestrate with Airflow or Prefect.  
3. Deploy a simple dashboard or a Streamlit preview of transformed data.

**How I use GitHub**
- Clear commit messages, small frequent commits, and a README in every repo.  
- I tag repos with topics so others can find them.

*Fun fact:* I call recipe testing “user acceptance testing.”
